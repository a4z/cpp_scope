= New C++ Scope

== 2022-03-10 Update

At the end of last week, i.e. 2022-03-03, I sent the two letter on to INCITS
and WG21. I am leaving the WG21 letter open for anyone who wants to sign it
if they so choose.

In the week since the INCTIS letter request was forward to the members
is being discussed. Although there's no definitive resolution yet, there
are some assertions from the conversation that are interesting:

* The current charter/scope allows for working on {CPP} Ecosystem topics.
  Example given is the SG15 work.

* The International Standard ISO/IEC 14882 only allows referring to concepts
  expressible in the virtual machine as defined in the standard.

* The IS ISO/IEC 14882 could change to allow for things like the debugging
  support functionality (https://wg21.link/P2546) by adding the appropriate
  definitional foundation.

Those are my brief interpretations of the conversations so far. There are
additional questions still up in the air. For example, is it possible to
create tooling file format International Standards outside of ISO/IEC 14882.

== About

Over the years of my involvement in the {CPP} standardization process there
has been a desire, and attempts, to standardize aspects of {CPP} that fall
outside of just the language. For example: build communication and
description, compiler options, package descriptions, compile database
descriptions, module dependency specification, module discoverability,
existence of DLLs. The response to considering those aspects has been either
"it's out of scope" or "we can only suggest" because the current scope does
not acknowledge that there is a {CPP} ecosystem of build systems, package
managers, linkers, files, and so on. This position has not only hindered
progress in those aspects, it has driven away contributors that wished
to work towards harmony in such systems.

As the {CPP} language continues to grow in use and capabilities, it is
paramount that we consider putting it methods to manage the
complexity of supporting what we can achieve with the language.

_Why choose to add the specific word "supporting tools, supporting
technologies, and supporting systems"?_

Like the current {CPP} scope (or charter) it hopes to define a category
of specifications without overly limiting what can be done in the future
as it is not possible to predict what will be needed. At the same time
using the key words "supporting" limits the realm squarely in the
{CPP} language.

Here "tools" pertains to compilers, linkers, build systems,
package managers, etc that work together to provide us with resulting
libraries, applications, and packages.

While "technologies" and "systems" refers to the broader space where {CPP}
code executes and interacts with.

_Isn't this too broad of a statement? You could do anything in that scope._

While technically true that almost anything is possible in choosing those words,
the eventual acceptance of any proposal that touches in these expanded areas
still has to survive the consensus based standardization process. Which means
that any new standard specifications will provide alternative views and
analysis taking into account the many voices of users and tool implementors
before advancing. The addition of these words opens the door to taking the
first step of having a proposal added to the queue to be debated.

_Why does WG21 need to specify this expanded area standardization? Why not
coordinate with some other standardization body?_

It would be possible to do many of the specifications that one wants and
needs outside of WG21. But by placing the responsibility outside of WG21
first creates friction between likely incoherent sets of goals. Such
incoherence could be resolved with coordination, but that will increase the
burden on both, or more, organizations. I.e. you would end up achieving
significantly less with significantly more effort. The current arrangement
of partitioned field expertise works well in reducing the burden for most
in the committee when working on standardization. The hope is that the
standards available with this expanded scope would work alongside and in
parallel to the current process. Instead of increasing the additional
burdens greatly.

== JTC1/SC22/WG21

Thank you for your interest in this open letter to expand the scope of
{CPP}, i.e. the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21. If you would like to co-sign the
letter please open a pull-request to add your name. In the letter there are
two sections:

JTC1/SC22/WG21 Members::
If you are a voting member of the {CPP} committee, aka WG21, you can add you name
to this section.

{CPP} Users::
If you one of the awesome {CPP} users that just loves the language you can add
your name to this section.

by editing in your own branch and subsequently creating a pull-request from
your branch.

This letter will only be open until March 2, 2022 8:00 AM Central Standard
Time. At which point it will be sent to the WG21 Convenor for consideration.

== INCITS/PL22.16

If you are a member of INCITS/PL22.16 you may also consider co-signing a
corresponding letter to the US national body {CPP} group.

by editing in your own branch and subsequently creating a pull-request from
your branch.

This letter will only be open until February 28, 2022 8:00 AM Central Standard
Time. At which point it will be sent to at least the INCITS/PL22.16 Chair. This
period is shorter than the above WG21 letter to fit within the time limit of
the currently open comment period for review of the charter.
